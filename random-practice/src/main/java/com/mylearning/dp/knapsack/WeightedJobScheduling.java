    The algorithm is:
    Sort the jobs by non-decreasing finish times.
    For each i from 1 to n, determine the maximum value of the schedule from the subsequence of jobs[0..i].
    Do this by comparing the inclusion of job[i] to the schedule to the exclusion of job[i] to the schedule, and then taking the max.
    To find the profit with inclusion of job[i], we need to find the latest job that doesnâ€™t conflict with job[i].
    The idea is to use Binary Search to find the latest non-conflicting job.
