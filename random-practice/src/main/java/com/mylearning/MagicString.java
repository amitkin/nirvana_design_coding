Julia calls a string magical if the following conditions are satisfied:
Each letter âˆˆ {a, e, i, o, u}.
"a" must only be followed by "e".
"e" must only be followed by "a" or "i".
"i" must only be followed by "a", "e", "o", or "u".
"o" must only be followed by "i" or "u".
"u" must only be followed by "a".

Complete the magicalStrings function in your editor. It has 1 parameter: an integer, n, denoting the desired length of a magical string. It must return an integer denoting the number of magical strings of length n, modulo (109 + 7).

Input Format
The locked stub code in your editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to your function:
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the desired length of a magical string.

Constraints
0 < n < 105

Output Format
Your function must return an integer denoting the number of magical strings of length n, modulo (109 + 7). This is printed to stdout by the locked stub code in your editor.

Explanation
Sample Case 0:

         If you were to visit each node in the tree, either by bfs or dfs
         time complexity will be very high. Let us try to count the possibilities
         without actually going through each of them

         The inspiration is a tree structure only, the tree with height n has leaf nodes
         of all possible magical strings of length n.
         If the vowel must follow vowel condition wasn't there, we know that if you have F(n)
         possible strings of length n, you just need to multiply 5*F(n) to get F(n+1).

         The only thing determining number of branches each leaf node of tree gets is which
         specific vowel it is. So let us keep a track of the ending vowels of each F(n) separately.

         F(n) = total number of magical strings of length n

         Let us count the number of words that end with a, e, i, o, u
         Lets call X(n) the number of words of length N ending with x
         So A(n) is the number of words of length N ending with a

         Here, F(n) = A(n) + E(n) + I(n) + O(n) + U(n)

         If n = 1, it is easy,
         A(n) = E(n) = I(n) = O(n) = U(n) = 1

         What happens now?
         To find the number of words of length N = 2 ending with a, look at all the vowels
         that can be followed by a. We have "e", "i" and "u".
         So total number of words of length N ending with "a" are
         total number of words of length N - 1 ending with "e" , "i", or "u"

         So, we have


         A(n) = E(n-1) + I(n-1) + U(n-1)
         E(n) = A(n-1) + I(n-1)
         I(n) = E(n-1) + O(n-1)
         O(n) = I(n-1)
         U(n) = I(n-1) + O(n-1)


         Let's use this recurrence relation to loop and count the numbers
         Let's call A(n-1) = Am and A(n) = An

         Let's start with n-1 (denoted as m) = 1
