**Designing a Traffic Signal Control System**

Object-oriented design and implementation of a Traffic Signal Control System using Java.

This system is crucial for managing traffic flow and ensuring safety at intersections.

**System Requirements**

The Traffic Signal Control System should:

    Signal Timing Management: Control the timing of traffic lights.
    Intersection Management: Manage multiple traffic signals at an intersection.
    Mode Configuration: Support different traffic modes.
    Emergency Override: Allow manual control in emergencies.

**Core Use Cases**

    Switching Signals: Change signals from red to green and vice versa.
    Timing Adjustment: Modify the duration of each signal.
    Mode Selection: Choose operational modes.
    Emergency Control: Manual override for emergencies.

**Key Classes**

    TrafficSignalSystem: Manages the system.
    TrafficLight: Represents an individual traffic light.
    IntersectionController: Manages lights at an intersection.
    TrafficControlPanel: For manual control and emergency overrides.
