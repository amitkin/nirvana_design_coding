In our project we start with modeling one orthogonal intersection controlled by a traffic light. Each roadway leading to and from
the intersection will have a fixed length (providing space for a fixed number of cars). The simulation is driven by a timer.

Cars arrive onto the four lanes of traffic leading to the intersection every timer unit with a probability 1:n (n selected by user
 - suggested value 6)
